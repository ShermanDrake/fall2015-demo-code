ng-model: provides 2-way data-binding, allowing the user actions in inputs in the view to change values in the model.

ng-class: lets you dynamically set classes on your elements, based on scope variables.

    1: You have a scope variable with a string value, and you want an element to have the class with that name

    2: You have a scope variable with a boolean value. If that value is true, apply a certain class to that element. If the value is false, do not apply that class to the element. 

    3: Both of the above. Use an array full of strings and objects.

ng-show: dynamically hide or reveal an element based on a boolean value.

ng-src/ng-href: dynamically set sources/hrefs for links and images. This prevents the browser from accidentally sending a request to a fake URL.
