What is Angular?

A strongly oppinionated front-end, MVC, Framework.

Framework: code that someone else has written that you can use in your project. It's bigger than a library. It is intended to be an all-in-one solution. 

MVC - Model View Controller: 
---------
    Model is your raw data.
    var topGun = {
        title: 'Top Gun',
    }
---------
    View is the visual representation of your model
---------
    Controllers are the glue that connects the view and the model


Imperative programming - The program performs a series of actions
    select the button
    listen for clicks on the button
    when the button is clicked, check if it has the .active class
    If it has the active class, remove it.
    If it does not have the active class, add it.


Declaritive programming - Declare relationships between different pieces of code, e.g. relationships between the model and the view.
    var buttonActive = false

    
    <button class="is button active? then .active" whenClicked="buttonActive = !buttonActive">
