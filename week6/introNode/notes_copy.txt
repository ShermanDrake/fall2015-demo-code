running a script is kind of like running a function, in that the script itself can have arguments

access command-line arguments with process.argv
argv is short for 'arguments vector'
process.argv[0] is ALWAYS 'node' ( or a filepath to node )
process.argv[1] is the script that is being run currently
process.argv[2+] is what you would naturally think of as the arguments to the script

use `module.exports` and `require()` to share code between files. Whatever is exported in one file can be required in another. 
require returns the value of module.exports

fs is a core module, so you can require it by name. You don't need to specify a file-path.
