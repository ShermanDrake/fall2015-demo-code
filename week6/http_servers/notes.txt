What happens when you type http://google.com into your URL bar in your browser?

first, we know we're using http, so we will send an http request to whatever server we're sending requests to.

DNS - domain name server
We reach out to the DNS, say we're looking for google.com, and the DNS server tells us the I.P. address where we can find it.

More specifically, we send the request to port 80 on google's server.

The servers at google will read our request.

Google server reads our request, determines who we are, what we want, etc. The server puts together a response packet to satisfy our request. In this case, the response is full of HTML.

All external resources that are linked in the HTML (stylesheets, javascript, images, etc) must be fetched with separate requests.
