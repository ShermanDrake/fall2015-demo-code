on a free-standing function, 'this' refers to the window.

On a function that is attached to an object (i.e. a method) this refers to the host object. 

In javascript, functions are objects, so they can have their own methods. 3 examples: call, apply, and bind.

Call and apply call the original function, and return whatever value that function returns. 

Bind returns a NEW function, with its 'this' context permanently bound.
