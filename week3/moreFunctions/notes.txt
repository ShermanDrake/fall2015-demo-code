callback: a function that you define, but you never call yourself. It is called by the system (the browser, the server, etc) when it is needed.

Angular doesn't like setTimeout or setInterval. If you change scope variables in a timeout, angular might not notice the change. Use angular's $timeout and $interval instead.

In javascript, functions are first-class citizens. You can put a function anywhere you would put any other value.
